# Javascript-Soap-Example
A quick and dirty javascript implementation of the SOAP API to get you up and running.

Please see the [documentation for the SOAP API](https://collivery.co.za/integration/api/soap).

Please note that this relies on [moszeed/easysoap](https://github.com/moszeed/easysoap), so you need to run `npm install easy-soap` in whatever directory you run this in.

For a RESTful API, with JS examples, please see [our API V3 documentation](https://collivery.net/documentation/v3/index.hml)
